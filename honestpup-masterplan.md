# HonestPup Master Plan
*The Complete Project Brief and Source of Truth*

## Executive Summary

HonestPup is a transparent, ethical puppy marketplace that connects verified breeders with families across the United States. Unlike traditional puppy marketplaces that hide fees, delay payments, and obscure breeder information, HonestPup operates on principles of honesty, fairness, and transparency.

This document serves as the central source of truth for all development work. Before starting any coding task, developers and AI agents must read this masterplan to understand the complete business context, technical requirements, and implementation priorities.

2. **For Breeders**: Fast payments (20% on sale, remainder on delivery), zero listing fees, easy inventory management, and professional support
3. **For the Industry**: Elimination of puppy mills, ethical breeding standards, and a trust-first marketplace

4. Guest checkout without forced registration

// Data Security
1. RLS policies enforce data access rules
2. Stripe handles all payment data (PCI compliant)
3. File uploads validated and optimized
4. API rate limiting and input validation
```
