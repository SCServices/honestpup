# User Authentication System Requirements

## Introduction

The HonestPup authentication system provides secure, role-based access for buyers, breeders, and administrators while supporting guest checkout for buyers. The system prioritizes user experience by not forcing account creation for purchases while maintaining security and proper access control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Role Authentication

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to authenticate based on my role (buyer, breeder, admin), so that I can access appropriate features and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL assign them a default role of 'buyer'
2. WHEN a breeder applies and is approved THEN the system SHALL update their role to 'breeder'
3. WHEN an admin creates accounts THEN the system SHALL allow role assignment during creation
4. IF a user has multiple roles THEN the system SHALL use the highest privilege level

### Requirement 2: Guest Checkout Support

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want to purchase puppies without creating an account, so that I can complete my purchase quickly without friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest proceeds to checkout THEN the system SHALL collect necessary contact information without requiring account creation
2. WHEN a guest completes a purchase THEN the system SHALL offer optional account creation with pre-filled information
3. IF a guest declines account creation THEN the system SHALL still provide order tracking via email/phone lookup
4. WHEN a guest later creates an account with the same email THEN the system SHALL associate previous orders

### Requirement 3: Social Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my Google or Facebook account, so that I can access the platform quickly without managing another password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses social login THEN the system SHALL support Google and Facebook OAuth
2. WHEN social authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or link to existing profile
3. IF email conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide account linking options
4. WHEN social profiles are used THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings and data minimization
