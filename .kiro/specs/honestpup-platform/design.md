# HonestPup Platform Design

## Overview

The HonestPup platform is designed as a modern, mobile-first web application that prioritizes transparency, trust, and user experience. The architecture follows a serverless approach using Next.js 14 with Supabase as the backend-as-a-service, ensuring scalability, security, and rapid development.

The design emphasizes ethical business practices through transparent pricing, fast payments, and verified breeder networks, while providing an intuitive user experience for families seeking puppies.
