# HonestPup AI Prompting Guide & Templates

> **Purpose**: This guide provides proven prompting strategies and ready-to-use templates for building HonestPup efficiently with Lovable, Cursor, or other AI coding assistants.

## üéØ Core Prompting Principles

### 1. Context-First Approach
Always provide the AI with:
- What you're building (specific feature)
- Where it fits in the app (page/component)
- Who will use it (buyer/breeder/admin)
- What problem it solves

### 2. Reference Documentation
Start prompts with: "Using the patterns from `[specific_doc].md`..."
- `database_schema.md` ‚Üí Database operations
- `design_guidelines.md` ‚Üí UI components
- `app_flow.md` ‚Üí User journeys
- `masterplan.md` ‚Üí Business logic

### 3. Incremental Building
Break complex features into smaller, testable chunks:
1. Data model first
2. Basic UI structure
3. Core functionality
4. Polish and edge cases

## üìã Master Prompt Templates

### üèóÔ∏è Feature Development Template

```markdown
I need to build [FEATURE NAME] for HonestPup.

Context:
- User Type: [buyer/breeder/admin]
- Location: [specific page/component]
- Purpose: [what problem this solves]

Requirements:
1. [Specific requirement 1]
2. [Specific requirement 2]
3. [Mobile-responsive design]
4. [Loading and error states]

Using patterns from:
- Database: [relevant tables from database_schema.md]
- Design: [component patterns from design_guidelines.md]
- Flow: [user journey from app_flow.md]

Success Criteria:
- [ ] Works on mobile (test at 375px)
- [ ] Handles loading states
- [ ] Shows appropriate errors
- [ ] Follows HonestPup design system
```

### üé® UI Component Template

```markdown
Create a [COMPONENT NAME] component for HonestPup.

Design Requirements:
- Follow color scheme: primary-green (#22C55E), accent-orange (#FB923C)
- Use shadcn/ui components as base
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Include hover states and transitions

Component Should:
1. [Primary function]
2. [Secondary function]
3. Show loading state when [condition]
4. Handle errors gracefully

Reference the [similar component] pattern from design_guidelines.md

Props:

Include proper TypeScript types based on database schema.
```

### üîê Authentication Flow Template

```markdown
Implement [AUTH FEATURE] for HonestPup.

Auth Requirements:
- User type: [buyer/breeder/admin]
- Allow guest checkout for buyers

## üí° Prompting Best Practices

### DO's ‚úÖ

1. **Be Specific About State**
   ```markdown
   "When the user clicks submit, show loading state, disable the button, 
   and display success message after completion"
   ```

2. **Include Error Scenarios**
   ```markdown
   "Handle these error cases: network failure, invalid data, 
   unauthorized access. Show user-friendly messages."
   ```

3. **Specify Data Types**
   ```markdown
   "Expect an array of PuppyListing objects with id: string, 
   name: string, price: number, and breeder: BreederProfile"
   ```

4. **Request Mobile Consideration**
   ```markdown
   "Ensure this works on mobile viewports starting at 375px. 
   Use touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px)."
   ```

### DON'T's ‚ùå

1. **Don't Be Vague**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå "Make a form"
   ‚úÖ "Create a breeder application form with fields for business name, 
       USDA license, breeds, experience years"
   ```

2. **Don't Skip Context**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå "Add search"  
   ‚úÖ "Add puppy search to the browse page that filters by breed, 
       price, and location using the puppies table"
   ```

3. **Don't Forget Edge Cases**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå "Show the puppies"
   ‚úÖ "Show puppies in a grid, handle empty state, loading state, 
       and error state with appropriate messages"
   ```
